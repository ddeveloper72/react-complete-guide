# Learning React JS

This application is the first in a series of mini-projects, used for learning work with the [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend framework.

In this application, I have begun to learn about

* how React works,
* building an application,
* building custom components,
* passing data via props (properties)
* the idea of Composition - props
* the JSX language,
* optimizing components

There are many more sections to work through. This is definitely one of the most versatile frontend framework worth learning.

The course, [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) is presented by [Maximilian Schwarzmuller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) on Udemy
